For Gmail configuration follow below instruction:
> Log in to your google account In Google Security "Less Secure Apps" turn OFF.
> Enable 2-Step authentication. Search for "App Passwords", and under "Select app" select "other"
> then under device type "Amibroker" without the quotes, then press "Generate" button.
> This produces a 16-digit passcode that is then used in Amibroker in place of your Gmail account password.
